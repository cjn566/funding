Each node either has it's own cost range, or sums it's children's minimum and maximum costs

Can have options?


purchase node DB representation:
  id: int
  parentId: int
  description: text
  isFolder: Boolean (or compute based on having children?)
  min cost: dollars
  max cost: dollars (optional)
  order: int
  isOpen: Boolean (?)

node in JS rep:
  id: int
  description: text
  isFolder: Boolean (or compute based on having children?)
  min cost: dollars
  max cost: dollars (optional)
  order: int
  isOpen: Boolean
  makeFolder()
  toggle()


node in UI:
  - is nested under parentId
  - is in the correct order
  - can expand / collapse
  - edit description
  - edit min / max cost
  - make into folder (will create a child with same cost range)
  - reorder
